Wind Turbine Blade Design Project


Project Overview

As part of MAE 4272 (Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory), our team designed, fabricated, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade optimized for power generation under realistic wind conditions. The objective was to maximize extracted power while meeting strict geometric, structural, and operational constraints, including compatibility with a standard hub, a maximum blade length of 6 inches, and a rotational speed below 2000 RPM. The blade was optimized for a wind environment described by a Weibull distribution, allowing the design to target the most energetically significant wind speeds rather than a single arbitrary condition.

Design Process

We implemented an iterative blade design methodology using Blade Element Theory in MATLAB to determine chord, twist, and pitch distributions along the blade span. The design used a NACA 4412 airfoil and assumed an optimal rotor with constant angle of attack, neglecting tip losses and wake rotation for simplicity. By incorporating structural stress calculations into the aerodynamic model, we ensured the blade remained well below the material's flexural strength at the target operating condition. Initial designs exceeded stress limits at higher rotational speeds, so the operating point was iteratively reduced to 1100 RPM, resulting in a conservative and structurally robust design with a large factor of safety.

Testing and Performance Evaluation

The final blade geometry was 3D-printed and experimentally tested in a wind tunnel using a magnetic particle torque brake. Power curves were generated by holding wind speed constant while incrementally increasing mechanical load, allowing us to analyze turbine performance across multiple operating points. Data collected included wind speed, rotational speed, torque, and mechanical power. While the blades performed reliably at higher rotational speeds and showed no signs of structural failure, unexpected behavior below ~1500 RPM prevented sustained operation near the design point. Despite this limitation, testing provided valuable insight into turbine behavior, brake-system interactions, and the importance of validating theoretical assumptions experimentally.

My Contribution

I was responsible for leading the blade geometry modeling and CAD preparation, ensuring the final design met all dimensional and hub-compatibility constraints and was ready for fabrication. I also contributed to the iterative aerodynamic-structural design process and collaborated closely with teammates during prototype refinement and testing.
