## Wind Turbine Blade Design Project

### Project Overview
As part of MAE 4272 (Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory), our team designed, fabricated, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade optimized for power generation under realistic wind conditions. The primary objective was to maximize power extraction while satisfying strict geometric, structural, and operational constraints, including compatibility with a standard hub, a maximum blade length of 6 inches, and an operating rotational speed below 2000 RPM. The blade was optimized for a wind environment described by a Weibull distribution, allowing the design to target the most energetically significant wind speeds rather than a single fixed condition.

### Design Process
An iterative blade design methodology based on Blade Element Theory was implemented in MATLAB to determine the chord, twist, and pitch distributions along the blade span. The design employed a NACA 4412 airfoil and assumed an optimal rotor operating at a constant angle of attack, neglecting tip losses and wake rotation for simplicity. Structural stress calculations were integrated into the aerodynamic model to ensure the blade remained well below the material's flexural strength at the target operating condition. Initial designs exceeded allowable stress levels at higher rotational speeds, so the operating point was iteratively reduced to 1100 RPM, resulting in a conservative and structurally robust design with a large factor of safety.

### Testing and Performance Evaluation
The finalized blade geometry was 3D-printed and experimentally tested in a wind tunnel using a magnetic particle torque brake. Power curves were obtained by holding wind speed constant while incrementally increasing mechanical load, enabling analysis of turbine performance across a range of operating conditions. Measured data included wind speed, rotational speed, torque, and mechanical power. While the blades performed reliably at higher rotational speeds and showed no signs of structural failure, unexpected behavior below approximately 1500 RPM prevented sustained operation near the design point. Despite this limitation, the testing provided valuable insight into turbine behavior, brake-system interactions, and the importance of experimentally validating theoretical assumptions.

### My Contribution
I led the blade geometry modeling and CAD preparation, ensuring the final design met all dimensional and hub-compatibility constraints and was ready for fabrication. I also contributed to the iterative aerodynamic-structural design process and collaborated closely with teammates during prototype refinement and experimental testing.
