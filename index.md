## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Tokunbo Oshinowo, and I am a senior at Cornell University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Aerospace. I consider myself an individual who thrives on actively engaging in diverse activities and constantly seeks opportunities for self-improvement and innovation. I am deeply committed to fostering positive change within my community, as I value the meaningful impact it creates in society. 

Beyond academics, I am a Cornell Engineering Bridges Scholar, a proud member of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Structures Team Lead for the Cornell Hyperloop Project Team. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, practicing the trumpet, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

My passions are rooted in making the world a better place, and I aim to contribute through my expertise in various CAD software, strong leadership abilities, and dedicated work ethic.
